# Coffee Maker Quest 2

A small dynamically-generated game based on the original *[Coffee Maker Quest](https://github.com/laboon/cs1632/tree/master/deliverables/1)* by Bill Laboon. I made this as a way to acclimate myself with Scala.

### Usage

This game requires both Java 8 and Scala build tool (sbt) installed. Should this be the case, running this game is as simple as this:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/brandonhang/cmq2.git
cd cmq2/
sbt run
```

A different game layout is played each time!
